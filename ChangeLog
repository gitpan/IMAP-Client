2006-09-28	Brenden Conte  <conteb@cpan.org>
	* 0.13 - Release
	* Fixed bug where revoke() would cause an error if the revoked permissions resulted in a null permission set.
	* Fixed a bug where valid quota responses with empty quota attributes would cause an error
	* Fixed bugs with most commands when mailboxes that contain spaces are used.  All mailboxes are now quoted once before being sent to the server - submitting a quoted mailbox will not result in two sets of quotes
	* Fixed documentation error in listing of valid tagless responses for the select/examine commands
	* Changed return values for all list/sub command to return an arrayref instead of an array for failure return value reasons.  Arrays will still be returned with a DEPRECIATED: warning sent to stdout for backward compatibility.

2006-08-31  Brenden Conte  <conteb@cpan.org>
	* 0.11 - Release
	* Adjusted select, examine to not add quotes around mailbox if quotes already exist
	* Optimized parse_fetch to work almost instantly (in program run-time terms) vs old code which ran into severe performance issues with large number of responses.
	* Fixed bug in sequence-set checking - now allows for *s (either alone - meaning just the last message - or at the end of a sequence set, like 1:* - meaning all messages)
	* Fixed bug in parse_fetch that caused problems with parsing more than one FETCH return per request
	* Changed debuglevels to bitmasks (no code changes, only logical).  Added bit 2 for parse_fetch debugging.
	* Fixed bug that accidentally interpreted email headers as response codes when the header name was in valid tag syntax and the value started with NO or BAD
	* Added (unconditional) quotes around mailbox name for select, examine
	* Fixed typo in example code
	* Added newline to error output if onerror mode is set to 'ABORT'
	* Minor testfile cleanup (for development)
	* Added extensive iplanet testing
	* Added callback for retrieving EXISTS, RECENT values that can appear almost anywhere

	* 0.10 - Release.  Jumped to .10 to signify important multi-server changes
	* Removed the "_active_server" functionality.  Instead, all connections will require new object, and class variables will keep track of connections
	* Fixed bug in parse_list_lsub for some servers that did not always quote mailbox names (Dalbec)
	* Fixed bad testing values (tests were right, values were wrong) (Hull)
	* Fixed errors in value setting for parsing fetch (Budic)
	* Added parsesublist test with iplanet responses
	* Added 'usertest' program with a more limited set of commands than admintest, but using multiple connections
